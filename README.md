A work in progress for importing and plotting .bin files from APM.
Comments/suggestions/improvements appreciated :).  As well as bug reports.

It would be really cool if someone could make a .exe or something of the code from the MissionPlanner project (https://github.com/diydrones/MissionPlanner/blob/master/Log/MatLab.cs) to convert the .bin to .mat way more quickly that could be called from MATLAB.
